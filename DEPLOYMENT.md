## Recommended Approach:

1. **For Quick Testing:** Use Expo Go (free, but limited)

## Quick Start with EAS (Recommended):

```bash
# 1. Install EAS CLI
npm install -g eas-cli

# 2. Login
eas login

# 3. Configure
eas build:configure

```

The builds will happen in the cloud - no need to run anything on your laptop!
